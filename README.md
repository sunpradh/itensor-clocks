# Clock Models with iTensor

It mainly implements the template class `Clock<int>` for [iTensor](https://www.itensor.org/)
as simulation with tensor networks of clock models of any order,
with some helper function for creating the Hamiltonian or other observables
(like correlators, order or disorder parameters)

The project is still in early stage
